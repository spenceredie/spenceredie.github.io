							<h1>Blackjack Card Counting Trainer</h1>
						</header>

						<p>A simple game for practicing card counting. In Blackjack, card counting involves
							associating each card value with the movement of a counter that starts at zero.
							Small-value cards increase the counter by one, mid-value cards have no effect,
							and high-value cards decrease the counter by one. The lower the counter is, the 
							more likely you know you are to encounter a low-value card.
						</p>
						<p>
							This game helped me improve my implementation of state machines, with each state
							being its own class inheriting from the base State class. Until this point I relied
							heavily on switch statements for state machines, which led to a lot of
							difficulty debugging.
						</p>
						<p>
							Other programming features this game involves include scene management, singleton 
							enforcement, and interfaces.
