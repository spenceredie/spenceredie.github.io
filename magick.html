							<h1>Magick: Proof of concept</h1>
						</header>

						<p>The project currently eating up my free time. I'm going for a perspective and control 
							scheme inspired by Battlerite, with a magic system that involves writing incantations 
							in a dead magical language.
						</p>
						<p>
							For this project I've devleoped a simple language parsing system in which
							parts of speech inherit from a base Word class and perform different functions;
							pronouns determine targeting, roots represent the spell's element, and
							suffixes represent the form those elements take. Adjectives hold a list of modifiers 
							that affect the properties of spells with matching tags (think Path of Exile's gem system). 
							Every word included in an incantation comes with the cost of increasing the total cast time, 
							but players can choose to end incantations early to change the outcome.
						</p>
						<p>
							Spells are stored in a dictionary with pronoun/root/suffix keys and spell values, so when 
							players write their incantations the spells are chosen dynamically. This gives me the freedom 
							to open up word order with declensions like what's done in Latin, without being so general
							that spells bleed together - I want a meaningful distinction between "cold AOE damage" and 
							"fire AOE damage."
						</p>
						<p>
							The game is still in progress, right now I'm working on adding enemy AI and filling out 
							the spell list.
						</p>
